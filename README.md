# run-from-death-and-eat
Snake like game where you play as * and D(death) tries to catch you. You don't get longer after eating, maybe i'll add it.

Another feature to add is to have the code get the lcd size. Right now it uses macros.

Includes such features as:

・Portals for the player at the end of screen!

・Death speeds up as you play, just like in real life! (actually only when death eats but whatever)

・Points counter! (displayed when you die)

・Diagonal movement of Death!

・You died? No problem! Just hit `1` on your remote for endless fun!

・Suitable for any LCD! (haven't tested, I only have 16x2)

・Smart food spawn algorith, developed by our top engineers, for perfect Eat Food and Run From DEATH™ experience!

・AI powered death!
